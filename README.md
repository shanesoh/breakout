breakout
========
CS1110 Final Project

 * 1) Implemented sounds for bricks breaking and ball hitting the paddle. There are two sound clips
 * for bricks breaking that are chosen randomly each time.
 * 2) We also implemented a mute toggle for sound -- key press "M" toggles the sound.
 * 3) Score keeper. When ball hits the bricks, points get added to user's score.
 * Cyan bricks: +10 points. Green bricks: +20 points. Yellow bricks: +30 points. Orange bricks: +40 points. Red bricks: +50 points.
 * 4) Improved user control. Left 1/4 and right 1/4 of the paddle return the ball in the direction it came from.
